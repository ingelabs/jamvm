# Overview

JamVM is an open-source Java Virtual Machine that aims to support the latest version of the JVM specification, while at the same time being compact and easy to understand.

This is a fork of the original [JamVM](https://jamvm.sourceforge.net/) project. The upstream project is not actively maintained anymore.

See the [README](README) file for instructions.
